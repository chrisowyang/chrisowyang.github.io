I'm Chris, a current PM at Uber, an ex-AI PM at Spotify and Seek AI, and a Stanford Business School graduate. A bit more about my experiences to date: 
* At Uber, I lead efforts on our tipping and earner incentives experiences.
* At Spotify, led data science and product efforts for [Discovery Mode](https://artists.spotify.com/en/discovery-mode), a $70M ARR sponsored recommendations marketplace. I also worked closely with the team developing [ScienceBox](https://spotify.design/article/designing-data-science-tools-at-spotify-part-2), our in house data science platform, as well as [Backstage](https://backstage.io/), our homegrown developer platform.
* I joined Seek AI where I built out the product org and launched key features such as Seek's [collaborative agent](https://www.seek.ai/blog/introducing-powered-by-seek-an-embedded-ai-data-analyst-for-your-customers), [core model](https://www.seek.ai/blog/announcing-seeker-1-natural-language-to-sql-model), and [Slack integration](https://www.seek.ai/blog/updated-slack-integration-for-seek-ai).
* I've consulted for a handful of seed/series A enterprise SaaS companies building AI products and features ([Aleph](https://getaleph.com/), [Soal](https://getsoal.com/), [Float](https://withfloat.io/)).
